# Rubiks-Cube

Solve a rubiks cube...
brute force is one method to solve, but how much
computation can be saved by solving to intermediate steps?
obviously having the algorithms to move between the
steps is the most reliable approach, but for a search
tree of 18 possible moves each step, what's the real change?
